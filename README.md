# CS303HW3

The program executes automatically without user input. The first thing it will output is the Queue that was formed using the Queue class. The queue will be displayed after move_to_rear() is called, so the number two should appear at the rear of the queue instead of the front. After that, The code will display the vector created to use for the search function that finds the last instance of a given number in the vector. The program will ask the user what number they would like to find  and gives the index to the user. After that, the program will display an unsorted list (queue), it will then sort the list and print the sorted list for the user.
